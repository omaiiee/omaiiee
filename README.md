- 👋 Hi, I’m @omaiiee
- 👀 I’m interested in hand-painted environment art & foliage production!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the above in 3D, always looking for new, fun and creative ways to fuse the worlds of 2D and 3D together. 2D-esque 3D styles are my favourite!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on video game jams and projects!
- 📫 How to reach me: @omaiiee on Instagram, Tumblr, Twitter/X & Discord
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: Contrary to popular belief, I am a Civ (6) enjoyer. (Putting this here because I've been playing it a lot lately xD)
